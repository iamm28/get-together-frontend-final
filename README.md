# Get Together

## Overview
A web application designed to facilitate new connections among users based on shared interest in attending local events.

The front end is made with JS library React [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

The back end can be found here https://github.com/iamm28/get-together-backend

## Motivation 
To develop an application that makes it easy to meet new friends and have the common interest and logistics laid out already.

## Using the Site
The user must log in or sign up and will be directed to the home page which displays the events they are attending and the people they were assigned to go with.
The user can also view the events on a calendar. The user can find more events by entering a date range and budget and it will search Eventbrite for events that fit.
The events then appear one at a time with details so the user can decide if they want to go or not. Instead of swiping yes or no to people on a mobile app, this allows you to click yes or no to events.
